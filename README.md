Automated content creation and distribution system focusing on short form content within the motorsports world.

Idea is to:

- Grab all of the best motorsport content of the week and produce quick mashups ('mixtapes')
- Distribute on short-form focused social channels (TikTok, IG Reels, YT Shorts)
- Turn content into weekly newsletter and podcast
- Automate as much of the process as possible
- Spend as little $ as possible

Using RSS feeds -> Zapier -> Airtable -> Pictory/11Labs -> Airtable -> End content platforms and OpenAI API throughout.
